<p>
  Points are automatically created by duplicating much of the information from the publisher. The name and XID may be 
  modified, but if "Accept point attribute updates" is checked the name may be overwritten if it is changed for the 
  point at the publisher. Furthermore, since the XID is the key upon which points between the publisher and the data
  source are matched, changing the XID will cause a new point to be created with the original XID, which will then 
  receive all of the updates for the point.
